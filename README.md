The program requires Python version at least 3.5.0. All commands below need to be executed in the same directory as this file.

## Simulation

The `runtm.py` script can simulate a Turing machine as required by the practical specification.

```
$ python3 -m runtm
usage: runtm.py [-h] machine input
```

## Analysis

Analysis for each of the solutions is implemented as a separated script which outputs CSV. They can be executed like this:

```
$ python3 -m analysis.sort
```
